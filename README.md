# Basic Network Packet Sniffer (Python)

This is a simple network packet sniffer I built using Python. It listens to network traffic and shows data from packets being sent or received on the computer.

I made this project as a way to start learning about **cybersecurity** and **networking** and as my internship task for Rhombix Technologies.
